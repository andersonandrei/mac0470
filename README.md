This is a subject of the undergrad course of Computer Science of the Univesity of SÃ£o Paulo. Here I'm going to describe my collaborations with the free software comunity.

I'm an undregadute student of Computer Science and I'm researching Vehicular Networks. In this subject I will use my research collaborating with the applications that I'm working.
I'm using the OMNeT++, an open network simulator and I intend to post my scenarios applications in this program.
Exist an extension of the OMNeT++ that simulate movements in the newtworks. 
A transmission method that I'm studying is the DASH and exist an application in the INET Framwork that implements it. 
This implementation is open on GitHub but is old, so me and my research group adapt it. To this subject I want to collaborate with this repository too.

The repository of my research is :
https://github.com/andersonandrei/VehicularNetworksIC

Topics:

- INET Framework examples :

	There is a description page to the possible contributions :
		https://inet.omnetpp.org/HowCanYouHelp.html

	And there is a topic :
	"As a researcher:
    When you review/validate models to be used for your project (advised!), share your findings
    Contribute your improvements and the models you write".

    And there is a description page to explain how to contribute:
	https://inet.omnetpp.org/ContribGettingStarted.html

	Information about the INET Framework repository:
	- Commits: 8787
	- Branches: 135
	- Releases: 44
	- Contributors: 26

Update commits:

- Week 19/03 :
	I finished the example project that I intend to submit to INET repository. I used it with my group in our scientific initiation in our first paper, submitted to SBRC2018 (http://www.sbrc2018.ufscar.br/en/) .

- Week 26/03 :
	I tried in the start of the week to readopt all the code of DASH by Navarro Joaquim, to then pull request it. I could not do it, but now I list the differences of his version and our version. A big part of his code, that I could not adopt, is to use in his particular OMNeT scenario and we are interested in a general use. So I intend to do a pull request with our "general version" and I intend to do it this week.

	Observation: I think is better to wait an answer by Navarro before I do a pull request of our scenario on the INET repository.

	In this week I also prepared my talk about Agile Methodology for this course.

- Week 02/04 :
	Because personal problems I did not working this week.

- Week 09/04 :
	I enjoyed the INET Google Groups, explain my purpose and ask how can I contribute with my project.

	I already have an answer, asking me more about my idea and project, to better analyze how can I help the community. So, I answered it with more details.
