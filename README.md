This is a subject of the undergrad course of Computer Science of the Univesity of SÃ£o Paulo. Here I'm going to describe my collaborations with the free software comunity.

I'm an undregadute student of Computer Science and I'm researching Vehicular Networks. In this subject I will use my research collaborating with the applications that I'm working.
I'm using the OMNeT++, an open network simulator and I intend to post my scenarios applications in this program.
Exist an extension of the OMNeT++ that simulate movements in the newtworks. 
A transmission method that I'm studying is the DASH and exist an application in the INET Framwork that implements it. 
This implementation is open on GitHub but is old, so me and my research group adapt it. To this subject I want to collaborate with this repository too.

The repository of my research is :
https://github.com/andersonandrei/VehicularNetworksIC

Topics:

- INET Framework examples :

There is a description page to the possible contributions :
	https://inet.omnetpp.org/HowCanYouHelp.html
And there is a topic : 

"As a researcher:

    When you review/validate models to be used for your project (advised!), share your findings
    Contribute your improvements and the models you write"


And there is a description page to explain how to contribute:
