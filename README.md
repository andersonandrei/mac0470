This is a subject of the undergrad course of Computer Science of the University of SÃ£o Paulo. Here I'm going to describe my collaborations with the free software community.

I'm an undergraduate student of Computer Science and I'm researching Vehicular Networks. In this subject I will use my research collaborating with the applications that I'm working.
I'm using the OMNeT++, an open network simulator and I intend to post my scenarios applications in this program.
Exist an extension of the OMNeT++ that simulate movements in the networks. 
A transmission method that I'm studying is the DASH and exist an application in the INET Framework that implements it. 
This implementation is open on GitHub but is old, so me and my research group adapt it. To this subject I want to collaborate with this repository too.

The repository of my research is :
https://github.com/andersonandrei/VehicularNetworksIC

Topics:

- INET Framework examples :

	There is a description page to the possible contributions :
		https://inet.omnetpp.org/HowCanYouHelp.html

	And there is a topic :
	"As a researcher:
    When you review/validate models to be used for your project (advised!), share your findings
    Contribute your improvements and the models you write".

    And there is a description page to explain how to contribute:
	https://inet.omnetpp.org/ContribGettingStarted.html

	Information about the INET Framework repository:
	- Commits: 8787
	- Branches: 135
	- Releases: 44
	- Contributors: 26

Update commits:

- Week 19/03 :
	I finished the example project that I intend to submit to INET repository. I used it with my group in our scientific initiation in our first paper, submitted to SBRC2018 (http://www.sbrc2018.ufscar.br/en/) .

- Week 26/03 :
	I tried in the start of the week to readopt all the code of DASH by Navarro Joaquim, to then pull request it. I could not do it, but now I list the differences of his version and our version. A big part of his code, that I could not adopt, is to use in his particular OMNeT scenario and we are interested in a general use. So I intend to do a pull request with our "general version" and I intend to do it this week.

	Observation: I think is better to wait an answer by Navarro before I do a pull request of our scenario on the INET repository.

	In this week I also prepared my talk about Agile Methodology for this course.

- Week 02/04 :
	Because personal problems I did not working this week.

- Week 09/04 :
	I enjoyed the INET Google Groups, explain my purpose and ask how can I contribute with my project.

	I already have an answer, asking me more about my idea and project, to better analyze how can I help the community. So, I answered it with more details.

- Week 16/04 :
	I had an answer in the INET Google Groups describing my possible next steps. They tell me where I should put my files into the
	repository.

	The IC project was accept in the SBRC2018 on WTG, so, in this week I was preparing my presentation to do a preview on 23/04.

- Week 23/04 : 
	In this week I intend to present my preview project to the development systems group of my college. So, I intend to collect feedbacks and improve my presentation in this week.

- Week 30/04 :
	In this week I made a pull request to the INET repository.

- Week 07/05 :
	I made a pull requested to the master branch but the group is working in the integration branch
	to update the 3.x version to the 4. Was recommended that I do the pull request to the 
	it to the integration branch. I did it now, but there are many modifications in 
	the integration branch, so my code is not compiling. I intend to correct it this week.

- Week 14/05 :
	I worked to do my presentation about Free Software in the Health.

- Week 21/05 : 
	I have started to work in the adaptation of my project in INET, but it look harder than I thought.
	So I intend to re start the project in the new version although to adapt what we did.
	I also worked in my presentation about Free Culture, Creative Commons and Open Knowledge.

- Week 28/05 :
	I tried to adopt my INET 3.x project to INET 4.0 but it has some problems. There is a new module 
	at the INET 4.0 to the TCP packages, so it broke my simulation when it is running.
	I couldn't correct it, so I did a pull request and sent a message asking for help.

- Week 04/06 :
	I received a answer with a little description about the error and some recommendation. I also received another message, by other developer of the INET, he did a new branch with my project and tried to correct it. I found a little error on my code, so I corrected and replied to the new branch creator that I corrected a little thing and ask him to continue helping me.
	I also have started to do my final report.

- Week 11/06 :
	I finished my final report and presentation. So I finished my work into this course. I will continue working on my contribution to the INET repository with my research.
