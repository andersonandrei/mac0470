This is a subject of the undergrad course of Computer Science of the Univesity of SÃ£o Paulo. Here I'm going to describe my collaborations with the free software comunity.

I'm an undregadute student of Computer Science and I'm researching Vehicular Networks. In this subject I will use my research collaborating with the applications that I'm working.
I'm using the OMNeT++, an open network simulator and I intend to post my scenarios applications in this program.
Exist an extension of the OMNeT++ that simulate movements in the newtworks. 
A transmission method tha I'm studying is the DASH and exist an application in the INET Framwork that implements it. 
This implementation is open on GitHub but is old, so me and my research group adapt it. To this subject I want to collaborate with this repository.

The repository of my research is :
